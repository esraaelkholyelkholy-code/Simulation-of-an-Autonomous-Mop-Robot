# Simulation of an Autonomous Mop Robot
## 📌 Project Overview
Our project models the function of an autonomous mop robot that cleans floors using minimal human effort by navigating the environment represented as a grid while avoiding obstacles, using the search algorithms: Breadth-First-Algorithm, Width-First-Algorithm, and A* search algorithms. And finally provides a comparative analysis of how different each search algorithm affects the robot's behavior and their performance metrics.
## 🎯 Project Objective
-	Explanation of the working mechanisms of BFS, DFS, A* search algorithms.
-	Visualization of the cleaning process.
-	A comparison of the metrics: time complexity, space complexity, path cost, solution optimality.
-	Analysis of the differences between the used search algorithms.
