# Autonomous Mop Robot Simulation using DFS Algorithm
## 🚀 Features
Explores the maximum depth which makes it faster in larger environments.

## 🧠 How it Works
The algorithm stores the cells of one path in a stack and explores until the maximum depth before going back to another. Which means that the robot keeps moving in one direction cleaning the cells in the way until it reaches a dead end or an obstacle then goes back the closest free cell and repeats the process.
