# Autonomous Mop Robot Simulation using A* Search Algorithm

## 🚀 Features
Optimal and complete as it finds the shortest most efficient path to the target.

## 🧠 How it Works
The algorithm selects the nearest free (uncleaned) cell as the target and finds the most efficient path between it and the robot’s current position ,after cleaning it the algorithm is applied to the next nearest cell until the whole floor is completely cleaned using the cost function: f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
